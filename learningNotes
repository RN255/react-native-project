1. # This was the first tutorial

# I first installed:

expo router
https://expo.github.io/router/docs/
I am using expo for this project

# It then said:

To run your project, run one of the following npm commands.

- npm run android
- npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do iOS development without a Mac
- npm run web

# I then create an app folder

with index.js inside
and \_layout.js

# build a layout

https://expo.github.io/router/docs/guides/

# install extra dependencies

Command Line:
npm install expo-font axios react-native-dotenv

# run the app

cmd: npm start
you can see it on the browser, there is a link!
it is also on expo go

# run the app with expo start

cmd: expo start
we can't see it on the web as there are many errors...
and can't run it in adroid either - no emulators...

# NB. I cannot run through an emulator without...

install andriod studio for andriod
have a mac for ios
so I will have to use expo go - how irritating...

# use the expo go application to view it

if it doesn't work, ctrl +c, cmd: npm install -g expo-cli
then cmd: expo-cli start --tunnel
then scan qr code, wait for bundle...

# there were some warnings to update react-native

so in cmd: npx react-native upgrade

# at 22:22 he brings in icons, styles, fonts, images and stuff in other folders

I will not do that for the time being
and he brings in a big folder of components...?
I'll miss most of it and pick up what I need

# I asked chatGPT

and the answers are better...
wow!
it works on both the web and the mobile.
I wouldn't work on the web browser
GPT said:
In the CMD:

npm install -g expo-cli
npm update

then:

npm start --reset-cache

now it works on both mobile (without tunnel) and web browser

AND it updates as you change things - just WOW, what a great day
